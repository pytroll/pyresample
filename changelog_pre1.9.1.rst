  neighbours. [Panu Lahtinen]
- Initial version of bilinear resampling. [Panu Lahtinen]

  NOTE: Only works if both source and destination are area definitions.
  Also to be added is handling for the cases where a__ equals zero (use
  linear solution of bx + c = 0), testing, logging and all the error
  handling.

- Allow areas to be flipped. [Martin Raspaud]
- Factorize get_xy_from_lonlat and get_xy_from_proj_coords. [Martin

v1.2.6 (2016-10-19)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.5 → 1.2.6. [Martin Raspaud]
- Pre master (#44) [Radar, Satellite and Nowcasting Division]

  * add a subset function to the geometry file

  Often subsets of the SEVIRI disk are save in
  SEVIRI products. This new function calculated the
  area extent needed for the specification of the area,
  starting from the SEVIRI full disk area object.

  * added the get_area_extent_for_subset function

  to the geometry.py file

  * new function for getting area subsets

  * new function get_xy_from_proj_coordinates

  retrieve the pixel indices x and y
  from the map projection coordinates in meter
  (very similar to get_xy_from_lonlat)

  * removed pyc file, that should not be in the git repository

- Add appveyor status badge to README. [davidh-ssec]
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'deni90/master' into pre-master-davidh.
  [davidh-ssec]
- Fix test_custom_uncert and test_gauss_uncert for mips* [Daniel
  Knezevic]
- Fix pykdtree install on appveyor by turning off OpenMP. [davidh-ssec]
- Update appveyor config to install missing headers required by
  pykdtree. [davidh-ssec]
- Change appveyor to use conda-forge instead of IOOS. [davidh-ssec]
- Add slack notifications from appveyor. [davidh-ssec]


v1.2.5 (2016-07-21)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.4 → 1.2.5. [Martin Raspaud]
- Fix EWA fornav for integer data and add test. [davidh-ssec]

  There was a bug when doing the averaging in EWA where the current pixel was being rounded based on the previous pixel's value instead of the current pixel. This only affects integer data because values above 0 are rounded up by 0.5 and values below 0 are rounded by 0.5, for floats this round value is 0.0.

- Fix certain compilers not liking integers being passed to isnan.
  [davidh-ssec]
- Replace catch_warnings in all tests with astropy version. [davidh-
  ssec]
- Use catch_warnings from astropy (or at least try to) [davidh-ssec]
- Test removing version specific warning checks in `test_swath_wrap`
  [davidh-ssec]
- Move USE_CYTHON handling to if main block in setup.py. [davidh-ssec]
- Fix isnan definition only if a macro doesn't already exist. [davidh-
  ssec]

  Numpy does some special macro stuff to define a good npy_isnan function. Some systems define a macro for it, others don't. Hopefully this works for all systems. A better solution might be to define a templated isnan that calls npy_isnan if it isn't an integer.

- fix EWA compile failure on windows python 3.5. [David Hoese]
- Make pykdtree install on appveyor optional. [davidh-ssec]
- Add pykdtree to appveyor dependencies. [davidh-ssec]
- Fix setup.py test on windows for multiprocessing tests. [davidh-ssec]

  On Windows when new processes are started the initially command is imported or re-executed. For setup.py this is a big problem since the usual boilerplate does not include `if __name__ == "__main__"` so the setup.py test command gets rerun and rerun. This results in the child processes never actually being run for newer versions of python (2.7+). There still seems to be an issue with `test_nearest_resize` on Windows.

- Merge pull request #41 from cpaulik/fix-windows-ewa. [David Hoese]

  Fix Windows CI import Error
- Install scipy in Windows CI to fix import problems. [Christoph Paulik]
- Fix copy/paste error in EWA fornav. [davidh-ssec]

  I had started rewriting EWA in cython then realized it was faster in straight C++ so copied/pasted the cython code and modified it. Seems like I missed this 'or' hanging around.

- Fix NAN constant/macro for EWA on Windows. [davidh-ssec]
- Merge branch 'add-windows-CI' into fix-windows-ewa. [davidh-ssec]
- CI: Add IOOS conda channel to get basemap for Windows and python > 2.
  [Christoph Paulik]
- Merge branch 'add-windows-CI' into fix-windows-ewa. [davidh-ssec]
- Add pyproj to conda install in Appveyor CI. [Christoph Paulik]
- Make extra_compile_args platform dependent. [Christoph Paulik]
- Add Appveyor CI configuration. [Christoph Paulik]

v1.2.4 (2016-06-27)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.3 → 1.2.4. [Martin Raspaud]
- Fix setup.py extension import and use error. [davidh-ssec]
- Fix case when __builtins__ is a dict. [Martin Raspaud]


v1.2.3 (2016-06-21)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.2 → 1.2.3. [Martin Raspaud]
- Fix list of package names in setup.py. [davidh-ssec]

  'pyresample.ewa' wasn't listed before and was not importable from an installed package.



v1.2.2 (2016-06-21)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.1 → 1.2.2. [Martin Raspaud]
- Add the header files to the MANIFEST.in. [Martin Raspaud]

  Without this, the compilation of the ewa extension crashes.


v1.2.1 (2016-06-21)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.2.0 → 1.2.1. [Martin Raspaud]
- Include EWA header files as dependency for extensions. [davidh-ssec]

  The .c and .cpp files are automatically included because they are listed as sources, but the header files are not. When building a source tarball (uploading to PyPI) the _fornav_templates.h file was not included and building would fail.

- Merge branch 'pre-master' of github.com:mraspaud/pyresample into pre-
  master. [Adam.Dybbroe]
- Merge branch 'pre-master' of github.com:mraspaud/pyresample into pre-
  master. [Adam.Dybbroe]

  Conflicts:
  	docs/source/conf.py

- Run the base class init function first. [Adam.Dybbroe]


v1.2.0 (2016-06-17)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.1.6 → 1.2.0. [Martin Raspaud]
- Merge branch 'northaholic-feature-lonlat2colrow' into pre-master.
  [Adam.Dybbroe]
- Add two convenience methods lonlat2colrow and colrow2lonlat to
  AreaDefinition-class. [Sauli Joro]
- Fix bug in EWA grid origin calculation. [davidh-ssec]

  Forgot that cell height was negative so ended up subtracting a negative, going in the wrong direction for the Y origin of the grid.

- Merge pull request #37 from davidh-ssec/feature-ewa-resampling. [David
  Hoese]

  Feature ewa resampling
- Fix bug in EWA conversion from AreaDefinition to upper-left origin
  X/Y. [davidh-ssec]

  I was using the area extent for the origin x/y locations, but the extent is actually the outer edge of the pixels so half a pixel needs to be added to each coordinate.

- Add EWA C extensions to mocked modules for read the docs. [davidh-
  ssec]

  Readthedocs.org fails to import the _ll2cr and _fornav extensions because it seems to not compile them properly. Their documentation isn't necessarily needed so I'm hoping that mocking them will let the import work.

- Add pyresample.ewa to API documentation list. [davidh-ssec]
- Update EWA wrapper functions to use explicit kwargs. [davidh-ssec]
- Correct comments and documentation in EWA documentation. [davidh-ssec]
- Add ll2cr and fornav wrappers to make calling easier. [davidh-ssec]

  Updated documentation with correct usage and added information why EWA is different than kdtree

- Fix print statements in documentation so doctests are python 3
  compatible. [davidh-ssec]
- Add pillow dependency for plot tests and quicklook extra. [davidh-
  ssec]
- Add 'areas.cfg' file to repository and modify doctests to use that
  instead. [davidh-ssec]
- Run doctests after unittests on travis. [davidh-ssec]
- Fix documentation for AreaDefinition object. [davidh-ssec]
- Update documentation to be numpy style and get rid of all warnings
  when building docs. [davidh-ssec]
- Create special requirements.txt for docs. [davidh-ssec]

  Readthedocs really doesn't like an empty string for the requirements file

- Try empty string for requirements file in readthedocs yaml. [davidh-
  ssec]
- Fix readthedocs yaml config file. [davidh-ssec]

  Readthedocs was using the requirements file during package installation, but was failing to install basemap (not needed for documentation build) so I attempted to make it an empty string in the yaml file. This makes Rtd hang on the build process. This should at least stop the hanging.

- Add napoleon docs extension and intial testing with numpy style
  docstrings. [davidh-ssec]
- Add working example for EWA resampling to docs. [davidh-ssec]

  I originally had this example but removed it when I had import problems. After I figured those out I forgot to put the original example back.

- Add basemap back in to the requirements.txt so that it can be
  installed on travis. [davidh-ssec]

  Similarly removed the requirements file when readthedocs is running and mocked third-party packages to documentation can still be built

- Fix setup.py requiring numpy for extension includes. [davidh-ssec]

  The EWA extensions require the numpy headers to be built. These are normally found by importing numpy and doing `numpy.get_includes()`. Obviously if this is run on a new environment numpy is probably not installed so a simple `python setup.py install` will fail.

- Add "quicklook" extra in to travis test install. [davidh-ssec]

  These packages are needed to properly test the "plot" package. These were included in requirements.txt but have been moved for now.

- Move plot test imports in to test functions for cleaner test failures.
  [davidh-ssec]
- Add readthedocs yaml file for configuration. [davidh-ssec]
- Remove mocked modules from sphinx docs conf.py. [davidh-ssec]

  This is the first step in making pyresamples docs buildable in the current readthedocs version

- Replace relative imports with absolute imports. [davidh-ssec]

  I noticed a lot of warnings and import problems with building pyresample's documentation because of these relative imports

- Add EWA documentation to swath.rst. [davidh-ssec]
- Add tests for EWA fornav module. [davidh-ssec]
- Update documentation for ll2cr and fornav cython. [davidh-ssec]
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'davidh_fork/feature-ewa-resampling' into
  feature-ewa-resampling. [davidh-ssec]

  # Conflicts:

- Remove old and unused polar2grid ll2cr and fornav python modules.
  [davidh-ssec]
- Fix travis tests on python 2.6. [davidh-ssec]
- Add ewa ll2cr tests to main test suite. [davidh-ssec]
- Add simple tests for ewa ll2cr. [davidh-ssec]

  These tests were adapted from Polar2Grid so some of the terminology or organization might reflect P2G's design rather than satpy or pyresample.

- Revert import multiprocessing setup.py for python 2.6 compatibility.
  [davidh-ssec]
- Fix old polar2grid import in ll2cr module. [davidh-ssec]

  [davidh-ssec]
- Remove unused code from fornav wrapper. [davidh-ssec]
- Add initial EWA files copied from Polar2Grid. [davidh-ssec]
- Add basic documentation to fornav cython function. [davidh-ssec]
- Remove old and unused polar2grid ll2cr and fornav python modules.

- Remove unused code from fornav wrapper. [davidh-ssec]
- Add initial EWA files copied from Polar2Grid. [davidh-ssec]
- Add .gitignore with python and C patterns. [davidh-ssec]
- Update tests so they don't fail on OSX. [davidh-ssec]

  OSX seems to calculate slightly different results from `_spatial_mp.Cartesian` regardless of numexpr being installed. Although the changes are small they seem to affect the results enough to fail this test compared to normal linux execution.

- Add 'load_tests' for easier test selection. [davidh-ssec]

  PyCharm and possibly other IDEs don't really play well with unittest TestSuites, but work as expected when `load_tests` is used.

- Make kd_tree test work on older numpy version. [Martin Raspaud]

  VisibleDeprecationWarning is not available in numpy <1.9.
- Adapt to newest pykdtree version. [Martin Raspaud]

  The kdtree object's attribute `data_pts` has been renamed to `data`.
- Run tests on python 3.5 in travis also. [Martin Raspaud]


v1.1.6 (2016-02-25)
-------------------
- update changelog. [Martin Raspaud]
- Bump version: 1.1.5 → 1.1.6. [Martin Raspaud]
- Fix #35 supporting scipy kdtree again. [Martin Raspaud]

  A previous commit was looking for a 'data_pts' attribute in the kdtree
  object, which is available in pykdtree, but not scipy.
- Merge pull request #32 from mitkin/master. [Martin Raspaud]

  [tests] Skip deprecation warnings in test_gauss_multi_uncert
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'gh-pytroll/pre-master' [Mikhail Itkin]
- Put quotes around pip version specifiers to make things work. [Martin

- Install the right matplotlib in travis. [Martin Raspaud]

  The latest matplotlib (1.5) doesn't support python 2.6 and 3.3. This patch
  chooses the right matplotlib version to install depending on the python
  version at hand.
- Skip deprecation warnings. [Mikhail Itkin]

  Catch the rest of the warnings. Check if there is only one, and
  whether it contains the relevant message ('possible more than 8
  neighbours found'). This patch is necessary for python 2.7.9 and newer

- Merge pull request #31 from bhawkins/fix-kdtree-dtype. [Martin
  Raspaud]

  Fix possible type mismatch with pykdtree.
- Add test to expose pykdtree TypeError exception. [Brian Hawkins]

- [test_plot] allow travis to test plot.py. [Mikhail Itkin]
- [pip+travis] use `requirements.txt` [Mikhail Itkin]

  Use `requirements.txt` instead of setuptools' `extras_require`
  for installing basemap.

  That is because PyPi basemap version won't find libgeos library
  so we resolve to use latest basemap from git. `Extras_require` don't
  allow providing custom links, only PyPi package names, so we have to
  specify links in requirements.txt. `dependency_links` argument to
  `setup` call is meant for cruicial dependencies, not custom ones, so we
  don't use them neither.
