Tutorials
=========

The below tutorials walk through a series of features provided by pyresample
with a larger overall goal in mind. These tutorials include the creation or
loading of data to provide an end-to-end example of using pyresample without
anything required by the user. Tutorials also assume very little prior
knowledge or experience with pyresample and users should be able to follow them
without needing a deep understanding of the topics. As such, tutorials will
typically avoid giving a lot of detail about the concepts involved beyond
stating what is being done. Tutorials differ from
:doc:`how-tos <../howtos/index>` in that how-tos focus on individual features
or tasks and assume some base level knowledge about the task being performed.
