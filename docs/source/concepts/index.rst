Concepts
========

This section of the documentation will discuss the high-level concepts
involved in the functionality that Pyresample provides. The descriptions
attempt to avoid relying on the code interfaces (objects, functions, etc) to
explain the concepts. Tying these concepts to Pyresample code is reserved for
the :doc:`../tutorials/index` and :doc:`../howtos/index` sections of the
documentation.
