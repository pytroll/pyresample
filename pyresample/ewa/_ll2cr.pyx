    This function is meant to operate on dynamic grids and is theoretically
    slower than the `ll2cr_static` function. Dynamic grids are those that
    have one or more set of parameters unspecified like the number of pixels
    in the grid (width, height) or the origin coordinates of the grid
    (origin_x, origin_y). This function will analyze the provided lon/lat data
    and determine what the missing parameters must be so all input swath data
    falls in the resulting grid.

    :param lon_arr: Numpy array of longitude floats
    :param lat_arr: Numpy array of latitude floats
    :param grid_info: dictionary of grid information (see below)
    :param fill_in: Fill value for input longitude and latitude arrays and used for output
    :param proj4_definition: PROJ.4 string projection definition
    :param cell_width: Pixel resolution in the X direction in projection space
    :param cell_height: Pixel resolution in the Y direction in projection space
    :param width: (optional) Number of pixels in the X direction in the final output grid
    :param height: (optional) Number of pixels in the Y direction in the final output grid
    :param origin_x: (optional) Grid X coordinate for the upper-left pixel of the output grid
    :param origin_y: (optional) Grid Y coordinate for the upper-left pixel of the output grid
    :returns: tuple(points_in_grid, cols_out, rows_out, origin_x, origin_y, width, height)

    Steps taken in this function:

        1. Convert (lon, lat) points to (X, Y) points in the projection space
        2. If grid is missing some parameters (dynamic grid), then fill them in
        3. Convert (X, Y) points to (column, row) points in the grid space

    Note longitude and latitude arrays are limited to 64-bit floats because
    of limitations in pyproj.
